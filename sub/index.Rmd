## What is my stuff worth?
Let's assume you are wondering whether it would be a good idea to sell a certain piece of your belongings on eBay. Usually, you are not sure about the price you can expect so you search for your article, a Samsung smart phone in this example:

!["Ebay1"](http://abload.de/img/ebay1xcp4x.png)

--- .class #id 

## But you can look at finished auctions instead

Since you find auctions that are still running, you look for finished auctions and probably receive a lot of results if the article you are trying to sell is common.

## Better: Let an app gather the auction results

It takes some time to search through multiple pages while trying to figure out the mean price as well as how much variability there is in the prices. This app searches for a product and then displays a histogram of the prices of recent auctions.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5}
hist(rnorm(50, mean=100, sd = 20), col = "blue", main ="Auction results",
     xlab = "Dollar")
```

## Just enter a search term and hit "Go!"

The app does not only display a histogram but also some summary statistics like the mean. Feel free to try out the app by searching for different products, thank you.
