# Ebay-Price-Summary-Shinyapp
This shiny-app allows the user to search for products on ebay.com and summarizes the final prices of the 
latest auctions that match the search and displays a histogram. The user can for example specify the type of 
auction and the maximum number of auctions that should be returned.
Not available anywhere online as an app since Ebay prohibits scraping the site. This was a demo app for a 
course on Coursera.com.
